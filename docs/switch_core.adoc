= Switch Core

== MESA
If MESA is used to control the Switch Core, the RTE port and Real Time Classification
must be done as described in the following sections.

=== RTE Port
The RTE is associated with port 4 of the switch. It is recommended that this 
port is placed as the last port in the port map and setup with interface type
MESA_PORT_INTERFACE_NO_CONNECTION. This is done to ensure that frames classified
as RTP frames can be forwarded to the RTE.

=== Real Time Classification
Classification to an RTP ID requires the following:

* The (VID, PCP) is enabled for Real Time classification (VID zero means untagged frames).
* The frame is matched by an RCL rule mapping to an RTP ID and forwarding to the RTE port.

See the MESA documentation for more details on RCL classification.
